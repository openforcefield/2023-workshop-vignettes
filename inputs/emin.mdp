title       = CHARMM steepest descent enrgy minimisation

; Parameters describing what to do, when to stop and what to save
integrator  = steep  ; Algorithm (steep = steepest descent minimization)
emtol       = 1000.0 ; Stop minimization when the maximum force < 1000.0 kJ/mol/nm
emstep      = 0.01   ; Minimization step size
nstenergy   = 500    ; save energies every 1.0 ps, so we can observe if we are successful
nsteps      = -1     ; run as long as we need
; Settings that make sure we run with parameters in harmony with the selected force-field
constraints             = h-bonds   ; bonds involving H are constrained
rcoulomb                = 0.9       ; short-range electrostatic cutoff (in nm)
rvdw                    = 0.9       ; short-range van der Waals cutoff (in nm)
vdw-modifier            = Force-switch ;  specific CHARMM
rvdw_switch             = 0.2       ;
DispCorr                = no        ; account for cut-off vdW scheme -
;in case of CHARMM DispCorr = EnerPres only for monolayers
coulombtype             = PME       ; Particle Mesh Ewald for long-range electrostatics
fourierspacing          = 0.15     ; grid spacing for FFT
